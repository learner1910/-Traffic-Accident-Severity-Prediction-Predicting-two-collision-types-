The main dependent attribute is ‘SEVERITY CODE’ . Here number 1 is assigned to property damage and ‘2’ is assigned to injury collision. Here after normalising the features through the class preprocessing.StandardScaler by removing the mean and scaling the unit variance. After that the dataset is split into training and testing data with a test data comprising of 20 % of the dataset. So, now after balancing severity code and input feature , the data has been analysed over 4 machine learning models which are Linear Regression, Decision tree, K-Nearest neighbours and Random Forest.
